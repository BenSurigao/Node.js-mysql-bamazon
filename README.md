# Node.js-mysql-bamazon

## Description
Bamazon is an inventory/shopping application that implements command lines from the npm inquirer package, npm mysql package, and uses MySQL database to store product information. This application provides a costumer user interface that guides the shopper with command prompts within a node command.

## MySQL Database
I created a MySQL schema in VScode and transferred the data to create a table for my bamazon products using MySQL Workbench.
